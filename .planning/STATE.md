## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Free service as default: Lower barrier to entry with Hugging Face (no API keys required)
- Browser preview vs terminal: Better image quality assessment in browser
- Single service per session: Simpler UX, avoid confusion with multiple keys/configs
- macOS only: Faster v1 delivery, can expand to other platforms later

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 4 planning:**
- Stability AI documentation was inaccessible during research (Cloudflare block)
- Resolution: Run `/gsd:research-phase 4` before planning Phase 4 to get authentication flow, error codes, and response format specifics

**Phase 1 testing:**
- Zoom directory structure verified on current version but no official API documentation
- Resolution: Dynamic path discovery with fallbacks implemented in Phase 1 (multiple possible directory names)
